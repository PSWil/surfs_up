# Surf's Up!

## Overview

For this project a local surf company, 'Surfs Up' has asked for my help in determining the best location for their future expansion. The shopâ€™s owner is primarily interested in expanding to Oahu and would like some more information on the weather conditions there year-round. In addition to the surf shop there are also plans to attach an ice cream stand, so good weather is an important element in making the business successful. Upon looking at the data the owner is particularly interested in the weather for the months of December and June and has asked us to take a closer look.

## Results

**June Temperature Statistics**

- The average temperature is 74.94 degrees
