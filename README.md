# Surf's Up!

## Overview

For this project a local surf company, 'Surfs Up' has asked for my help in determining the best location for their future expansion. The shopâ€™s owner is primarily interested in expanding to Oahu and would like some more information on the weather conditions there year-round. In addition to the surf shop there are also plans to attach an ice cream stand, so good weather is an important element in making the business successful. Upon looking at the data the owner is particularly interested in the weather for the months of December and June and has asked us to take a closer look.

## Results

**June Temperature Statistics**

- The average temperature is 74.94 degrees
- The temperature ranges from 64-85 degrees
- While the temperature is 77 degrees or higher for about one week out of the month

**December Temperature Statistics**

- The average temperature is 71.04 degrees
- The temperature ranges from 56-83 degrees
- The temperature is 69 degrees or lower for about one week out of the month

## Summary

Now that we can see what the temperatures look like durring the coldest and hottest months the owner of 'Surfs Up' has a better expectation of how the business should preform durring these months. With December being one of the coldest months of the year, we can see that temperatures range from 56 to 69 for about one week. The colder weather may drive sales for wetsuits and other related gear but ice cream sales may not be as rewarding, and volume in colder months may not justify its overhead. However, theses temperatures a very mild compared to many places people will be visiting. June being one of the hottest months presents different opportunities with the hottest week of the month ranging from 77 to 85 degrees. This should be excelent temperatures to drive ice cream sales.

In addition to this analysis, I think it would be benificial to dive further into the weather data. Making additional queries into the precipitation durring these months would help better understand the environment. For instance we could look into the amount of rain dropped and the severity of the rain too see how that could affect sales. We could also look into wind records to see which months we can expect comfortable weather or more harsh conditions.

Oahu looks like it is going to be an excelent place for 'Surfs Up' to expand too and the owner is happy with our analysis!
